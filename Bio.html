    <h1>Hi, I'm Jay</h1>
    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <p>Hi, you may know me as Olawale, but most people call me Jay as I was named after my dad. Jay is short for Junior, in case you were wondering.</p>
    <p>You may already know I have an interest in the Audi brand, not because of the badge, but because I appreciate the design and specs you get when it comes to Audi models.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I think Audi's are certainly better than Merceds anyway, espcially when it comes to value for money, you get more bang for your buck and more leg room in the regular size hatchbacks for my 6''2 legs.</p>

    <br>

    <p> I've probably given off the impression that I'm a car fanatic which is not actually the case, so I'll tell you a little bit more about me.
    
    </p>I'm originally from London and have been living in Manchester for under a year, I've enjoyed my time in the city so far and might go as far as saying I prefer Manchester to London, I don't miss having to pay congestion charge to drive into town.
